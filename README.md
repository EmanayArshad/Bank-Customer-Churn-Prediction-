# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a bank customer will exit (churn) or stay with the bank using Machine Learning models.  
The goal is to help banks identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention measures.

## Project Overview
Customer churn (attrition) refers to when customers stop using a company’s services.  
In banking, customer retention is critical as acquiring new customers costs much more than retaining existing ones.  

This project uses classification algorithms to predict churn based on customer features such as:
- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Credit Card ownership
- Active Membership
- Estimated Salary
